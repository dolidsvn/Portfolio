        <div class="content">This is a fully functional website that run on the basis of handtrack.js
            developed by victor dibia .This website removes all the dependencies to be
            installed from existing GUI model that produces the same result. This website
            is user friendly for interactive providing the size of pencil and with few available
            colours to user preferences.It works fluently under good conditions of lights .we
            can also adjust the hand tracking accuracy in case of low light conditions.We
            don’t need to install any dependencies and other environment such as anaconda
            and libraries like opencv and also training of models.This website is ready to
            use in any low specification computers as the processing completely doesn’t
            take in the local system.<br>In future in this website we add some advance features like auto recognition
            of alphabets and shapes for accurate results.Including 3D drawing like rotating
            the axis would definitely put this website in top of order from other whiteboard website.Having an interactive kids section with music and art tutorial
            can also be implemented.</div>
